# 🦸 Marvel PHP SDK

Welcome to the **Marvel PHP SDK**, a lightweight and easy-to-use SDK designed to interact with
the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/), built on top of the robust [Saloon](https://docs.saloon.dev)
library.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is a work in progress. Currently, it supports only the endpoints I need for another app I'm building.
> However, the SDK is designed to be extensible, making it easy to add support for additional endpoints.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

You can install the SDK via Composer:

```bash
composer require chronoarc/marvel-sdk
```

### Usage

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$publicKey = 'your-public-key-here';
$privateKey = 'your-private-key-here';

$marvel = new  Chronoarc\Marvel\Marvel($publicKey, $privateKey);

$superhero = ['name' => 'Spider-Man (Peter Parker)', 'id' => 1009610];

$characters = $marvel->characters()->search(name: $superhero['name']);
$characters->dto(); // Chronoarc\Marvel\Dto\CharacterDataWrapper

$character = $marvel->characters()->getCharacter($superhero['id']);
$character->dto(); // Chronoarc\Marvel\Dto\CharacterDataWrapper

$characterSeries = $marvel->characters()->getCharacterSeries($superhero['id']);
$characterSeries->dto(); // Chronoarc\Marvel\Dto\SeriesDataWrapper

$characterComics = $marvel->characters()->getCharacterComics($superhero['id']);
$characterComics->dto(); // Chronoarc\Marvel\Dto\ComicDataWrapper

$characterEvents = $marvel->characters()->getCharacterEvents($superhero['id']);
$characterEvents->dto(); // Chronoarc\Marvel\Dto\EventDataWrapper

$characterStories = $marvel->characters()->getCharacterStories($superhero['id']);

This SDK is made for ChronoArc, an app I am trying to build an app that lets you create reading guides, subscribe to
already created guides, and track your
progress towards reading a specific guide.

There's another SDK that uses Comicvine API, which is also part of the ChronoArc project. You can check it
out [chronoarc/comicvine-sdk](https://github.com/fakeheal/comicvine-sdk).
